#Technical Decisions and Assumptions#

**Stack and Tooling**
1. Vite + React19 : lean build suited for the assignment as a SPA
2. React Router v7 : with three pages to work with, i opt for a simple client side routing
3. Tailwind CSS : small production CSS 
4. Jest & RTL : focused on DOM to align with user's behaviours and experiences
